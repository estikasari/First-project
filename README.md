# About the project

I worked on this project as part of my final assignment for the Data Science Bootcamp at dibimbing.id.
Completing this task was quite challenging as it had to be done within a tight 3-week timeframe.
<p> One of the valuable lessons I gained was during the data cleaning process. After going through a series of steps, from simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model evaluation, I discovered hidden duplicate data and biases, such as patients undergoing multiple surgeries within a single hospitalization episode.
<p> Interestingly, I only identified these issues after completing the modeling phase and revisiting the data through a deep-dive EDA.
It turns out that deep-dive EDA is a crucial milestone in the data processing journey!

<h2>Topic</h2>
  <p>Prediction of Length of Stay (LOS) in Post-Surgical Patients</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The issue of Length of Stay (LOS) in postoperative patients poses a significant challenge in hospital management. LOS refers to the duration a patient spends in the hospital after a surgical procedure. Several issues related to postoperative LOS are associated with hospital management efficiency:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Patients undergoing surgery tend to have a longer LOS. It is essential to identify risk factors related to LOS.</li>
    <li>Postoperative LOS can impact the availability of hospital resources such as ward space, beds, and personnel, necessitating planning for optimal resource utilization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predicting postoperative LOS will assist hospitals in efficiently planning resources such as ward space, beds, medical personnel, and equipment, ultimately impacting cost efficiency.</li>
    <li>Predicting postoperative LOS aids in patient care planning, allowing hospitals to identify patients who may need additional care or preventive measures. More effective and timely care will enhance patient satisfaction and the hospital's reputation.</li>
    <li>Predicting postoperative LOS also facilitates hospital administration and management, enabling more efficient and organized patient management in terms of medical documentation, scheduling, and other administrative tasks.</li>
  </ul>
